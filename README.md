# Eccentric Vases Website

A sample webpage for the commercial selling of a product (in this case vases) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It features a clean, responsive design with bootstrap, flex and grid.

I really enjoyed going for a green main colour as it often isn't seen much with other websites. Also I thought "Eccentric" sounded cool and then I googled it to find out it means "weird". I was too in love with the name by that point to change it - I mean my product owner told me to keep the name.
